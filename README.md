# RLE morph
Library which uses modified run-length encoding to do basic morphological operations on binary images (dilation and erosion).

Algorithm is taken from paper [Fast Algorithms for Binary Dilation and Erosion Using Run-Length Encoding ](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0535/5c17fe35eedfd4b6055a010fd65c5a25f04a.pdf)

Features:
- [x] Dilation
- [ ] Erosion
- [ ] Optimize implementation
